# Archived Learning Scripts

This directory contains earlier scripts created during the initial development
and learning phase of the project.

## Files
- `log_analyzer.py`
  - Initial log parsing script
  - Focused on counting log severity types
  - Introduced file I/O and line-by-line parsing

- `log_reporter.py`
  - Extended analyzer to generate timestamped reports
  - Added file output and basic reporting structure

These scripts are preserved to demonstrate project evolution and learning
progression. The primary, production-ready tool is `ioc_scanner.py` in the
repository root.
